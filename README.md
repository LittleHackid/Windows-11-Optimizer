# Optimizing Limited Resources for Better Device Performance

In my long journey and hard work optimizing the very limited resources that companies provide us, I've realized that the only way to keep your device from dying is to have a good configuration that allows you to use only the necessary GPU for the simplest tasks.

Although these optimizations may not look very flashy, they help your computer reserve at least **15% of its power** for essential tasks. It may not seem like much, but you will definitely notice the difference.

## What this tool does

I've created and installed an `.exe` file that performs **4 specific actions** to improve your system's efficiency:

- Removes animations  
- Removes transparencies  
- Removes visual effects  
- Deletes temporary files from `%temp%` and `C:\Windows\Temp`

---

## Error Handling

If any of the processes fail, the program will notify you. It handles four types of errors, one for each step, and reports:

- Which files are missing (if any)  
- Which files could not be deleted because they are currently in use (in `%temp%` and `TEMP` folders)

I sincerely hope this code helps someone out there.
